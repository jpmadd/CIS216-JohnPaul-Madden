# CIS216-JohnPaul-Madden
Hi, It's JohnPaul! I am taking this class as a continuation of my CIS106 class last semester. CIS106 was what introduced coding to me and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it and how well I did in it. I put a lot of work into the class and found it rewarding when I wrapped up my semester by finishing the final exam. Since I had such a good experience in CIS106 I decide to further myself down the programming route. Talking to counselors and a friend going into programming I decided that this was the obvious next step. I hope to do well in this class so I can fulfill my ambitions of becoming some type of software developer. My dream would be to be able to develop my own start-up/company using coding skills as a driving force for success. For this class, I will be using Python. I've selected Python because it's what I used in 106, so it's the language I'm most comfortable and knowledgeable in. I intend to use Python to complete assignments in what is a very universally known language.
